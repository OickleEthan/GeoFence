# Day 3 (Polish + Robustness + README)

## Goal
Make it interview-ready: clarity, reliability, and good explanations.

## Robustness
- [x] STALE state: mark objects stale if last_seen exceeds threshold
- [x] Optional rule: LOW_CONFIDENCE_IN_ZONE
- [x] Anti-spam improvements: cooldown window per object/zone/rule

## UI polish
- [x] Filters: category, status, confidence threshold
- [x] Better details panel (speed, heading, confidence, last seen age)
- [x] Map usability (follow object toggle optional)

## README
- [x] Fill architecture section with diagrams or ASCII blocks
- [x] Document tradeoffs and failure modes
- [x] Document run instructions and demo steps

## Optional if time remains
- [x] WebSocket streaming for telemetry + alerts
- [x] Polygon drawing tool (upgrade from bbox)

## Final deliverable
Clean repo with reproducible run instructions and a crisp 1–2 page design explanation.
